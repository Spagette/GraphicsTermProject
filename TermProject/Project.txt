Hello Prof. Zeyun Yu
 
Here is my term project idea:
 
1.) I want to do a 3D lighting project. -done
2.) Any “.off” file will work with the program. 
	--add a few different .off models to proj dir
	--allow users to loop through models
	--select specific model through menus
3.) Users will be able to cycle through a list of models to look at in the light.
	--^
4.) The lights will be able to be moved and will change color. 
	--add a few light sources
	--add movement capability
	--add change color ability
	--stretch-goal-- add in light animation
	---lights smoothly move and change colors
	---separate menu options for moving and color change animation
5.) The normal of each plane will be calculated to provide better lighting effects. 
	--calculate normal of each plane/points of plane
	--use this information with lighting
6.) The camera will be able to be moved to see different angles of the model. 
	--camera can be swiveled around the object for different view points
7.) The project will utilize C++ and OpenGL for implementation. -done
I am planning to do the project alone. Is this an appropriate idea for the term project?
