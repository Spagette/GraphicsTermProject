Normals for each face needs to be calculated for lighting to work correctly

1.) I want to do a 3D lighting project. -Done
2.) Any “.off” file will work with the program.  -Lab10, Lab08 -Done
	--add a few different .off models to proj dir 
	--allow users to loop through models 
	--select specific model through menus
3.) Users will be able to cycle through a list of models to look at in the light. -Done
	--^
4.) The lights will be able to be moved and will change color. -Lab11,  Lab08
	--add a few light sources
	--add movement capability
	--add change color ability - menu
	--stretch-goal-- add in light animation
	---lights smoothly move and change colors -glutTimerFunc
	---separate menu options for moving and color change animation
5.) The normal of each plane will be calculated to provide better lighting effects. -Lab11
	--calculate normal of each plane/points of plane
	--use this information with lighting
6.) The camera will be able to be moved to see different angles of the model. -done
	--camera can be swiveled around the object for different view points
7.) implement different types of shading(Flat, Gouraud, Phong) -lecture 23
	--lecture 23
	--https://uwmil.instructure.com/courses/210322/files/10735000?module_item_id=3715334
	--normal vector ex -Lab09
8.) The project will utilize C++ and OpenGL for implementation. -done
9.) Object is in the middle of the screen and are scaled to the same size. -done
	--hint
	---find average position of points in x,y,z
	---shift all x,y,z so average is on origin
	---find absolute max of x,y,z
	---devide all x,y,z by max of respecting axis
	---object will be at most 1 big in each direction

 Lab01 - Creating a project
